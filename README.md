I will share the plans once they're done. Ofc it's a wip project, then it could change over time.

## Hardware

### Libraries used

#### Eagle libraries
- [A4988](https://github.com/suzakulab/Eagle-Library-Pololu)
- [ESP12](https://github.com/handiko/ESP-12EF-Eagle-Library)

### Parts

- Stepper: `Nema 17`
- Stepper controller: `A4988`
- Card: `ESP-12E` (but should work with any `ESP8266`)
- Power supply: an old computer PSU. You probably have one or two in your garage, right next to your 512MB RAM parts.
